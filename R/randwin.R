#'Climate window analysis for randomised data
#'
#'Will randomise biological data and carry out a climate window analysis. Used
#'to help determine the chance of obtaining an observed result at random.
#'@param repeats The number of times that data will be randomised and analysed 
#'  for climate windows
#'@param Xvar The climate variable of interest. Please specify the parent 
#'  environment and variable (e.g. Climate$Temp)
#'@param CDate The climate date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the parent
#'  environment and variable name (e.g. Climate$Date).
#'@param BDate The biological date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the 
#'  parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Date).
#'@param baseline The baseline model structure used for testing correlation. 
#'  Currently known to support lm, glm, lmer and glmer objects.
#'@param furthest The furthest number of time intervals (set by CINTERVAL) back 
#'  from the cutoff date or biological record that you want to include in your 
#'  climate window search.
#'@param closest The closest number of time intervals (set by CINTERVAL) back 
#'  from the cutoff date or biological record that you want to include in your 
#'  climate window search.
#'@param STAT The aggregate statistic used to analyse the climate data. Can 
#'  currently use basic R statistics (e.g. mean, min), as well as slope. 
#'  Additional aggregate statistics can be created using the format function(x)
#'  (...). See FUN in \code{\link{apply}} for more detail.
#'@param FUNC The function of the climate variable.
#'@param FIXED TRUE or FALSE, whether you wish the climate window to be variable
#'  (i.e. the number of days before a biological record is measured) or fixed 
#'  (i.e. number of days before a set point in time).
#'@param cutoff.day,cutoff.month If FIXED is TRUE, the day and month of the year
#'  from which the fixed window analysis will be set.
#'@param CMISSING TRUE or FALSE, determines what should be done if there is 
#'  missing climate data. If false, the function will not run if missing climate
#'  data is encountered. If true, any records affected by missing climate data 
#'  will be deleted from climate window analysis.
#'@param CINTERVAL The resolution at which climate window analysis can be 
#'  conducted. Can be days ("D"), weeks ("W"), or months ("M"). Note the units 
#'  of parameters 'furthest' and 'closest' will differ depending on the chouice 
#'  of CINTERVAL.
#'@return Will return a dataframe containing information on all fitted climate
#'  windows. See \code{\link{MassRand}} as an example.
