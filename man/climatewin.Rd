\title{Test for a climate windows in data.}
\usage{
climatewin(xvar, cdate, bdate, baseline, furthest, closest, type, cutoff.day,
  cutoff.month, stat = "mean", func = "lin", cmissing = FALSE,
  cinterval = "day", cvk = 0, upper = NA, lower = NA, thresh = FALSE,
  centre = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{xvar}{A list object containing all climate variables of interest.
Please specify the parent environment and variable name (e.g. climate$Temp).}

\item{cdate}{The climate date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the
parent environment and variable name (e.g. climate$Date).}

\item{bdate}{The biological date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the
parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Date).}

\item{baseline}{The baseline model structure used for model testing.
Currently known to support lm, glm, lmer and glmer objects.}

\item{furthest}{The furthest number of time intervals (set by cinterval)
back from the cutoff date or biological record that will be included in
the climate window search.}

\item{closest}{The closest number of time intervals (set by cinterval) back
from the cutoff date or biological record that will be included in the
climate window search.}

\item{type}{fixed or variable, whether you wish the climate window to be
variable (i.e. the number of days before each biological record is
measured) or fixed (i.e. number of days before a set point in time).}

\item{cutoff.day,cutoff.month}{If type is "fixed", the day and month of the
year from which the fixed window analysis will start.}

\item{stat}{The aggregate statistics used to analyse the climate data. Can
currently use basic R statistics (e.g. mean, min), as well as slope.
Additional aggregate statistics can be created using the format
function(x) (...). See FUN in \code{\link{apply}} for more detail.}

\item{func}{The functions used to fit the climate variable. Can be linear
("lin"), quadratic ("quad"), cubic ("cub"), inverse ("inv") or log ("log").}

\item{cmissing}{TRUE or FALSE, determines what should be done if there are
missing climate data. If FALSE, the function will not run if missing
climate data is encountered. If TRUE, any records affected by missing
climate data will be removed from climate window analysis.}

\item{cinterval}{The resolution at which climate window analysis will be
conducted. May be days ("day"), weeks ("week"), or months ("month"). Note the units
of parameters 'furthest' and 'closest' will differ depending on the choice
of cinterval.}

\item{cvk}{The number of folds used for k-fold cross validation. By default
this value is set to 0, so no cross validation occurs. Value should be a
minimum of 2 for cross validation to occur.}

\item{upper}{Cut-off values used to determine growing degree days or positive
climate thresholds (depending on parameter thresh). Note that when values
of lower and upper are both provided, climatewin will instead calculate an
optimal climate zone.}

\item{lower}{Cut-off values used to determine chill days or negative
climate thresholds (depending on parameter thresh). Note that when values
of lower and upper are both provided, climatewin will instead calculate an
optimal climate zone.}

\item{thresh}{TRUE or FALSE. Determines whether to use values of upper and
lower to calculate binary climate data (thresh = TRUE), or to use for
growing degree days (thresh = FALSE).}

\item{centre}{Variable used for mean centring (e.g. Year, Site, Individual).
Please specify the parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Year).}
}
\value{
Will return a list with an output for each tested set of climate
 window parameters. Each list item contains three objects:

 \itemize{
 \item BestModel, a model object. The strongest climate window model based on AICc.
 \item BestModelData, a dataframe with the data used to fit the strongest
 climate window model.
 \item Dataset, a dataframe with information on all fitted climate windows.
 Ordered using deltaAICc, with most negative deltaAICc values first.
 See \code{\link{MassOutput}} as an example.}

 In addition, the returned list includes an object 'combos', a summary of all
 tested sets of climate window parameters.
}
\description{
Finds the time period when a biological variable is most strongly affected
by climate. Note that climate data and biological data should be loaded as
two seperate objects. Both objects should contain a date column to designate
when the data were recorded (dd/mm/yyyy) and a response variable column.
}
\details{
Note that climatewin allows you to test multiple possible parameters with the
same code (e.g. func, stat, xvar). See examples for more detail.
