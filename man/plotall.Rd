\title{Visualise climate window data}
\usage{
plotall(Dataset, DatasetRand = NA, BestModel = NA, BestModelData = NA,
  CW1 = 0.95, CW2 = 0.5, CW3 = 0.25, HISTQ = 0.99)
}
\arguments{
\item{Dataset}{A dataframe containing information on all fitted climate
windows. Output from \code{\link{climatewin}}.}

\item{DatasetRand}{A dataframe containing information on all fitted climate
windows using randomised data. Output from \code{\link{randwin}}.}

\item{BestModel}{A model object. The strongest climate window model. Returned
from \code{\link{singlewin}} or \code{\link{climatewin}}.}

\item{BestModelData}{A dataframe containing the biological and climate data
used to fit the strongest climate window model. Output from
\code{\link{singlewin}} or \code{\link{climatewin}}.}

\item{CW1,CW2,CW3}{Cumulative weight levels used to visualise model weight
distribution. See \code{\link{plotweights}} for more detail.}

\item{HISTQ}{If DatasetRand is provided. The quantile of the randomised data
to be compared with non-randomised data. Can be used to determine the
likelihood of finding a climate window model of a given AICc value by
chance.}
}
\value{
Will return a panel of 6-8 plots:

 \itemize{ \item DeltaAICc: A colour plot of model deltaAICc values (larger
 negative values indicate stronger models). DeltaAICc is the difference
 between AICc of each climate window model and the baseline model.

 \item Model weight: A colour plot showing the distribution of cumulative
 model weights. Gradient levels determined by parameters CW1,CW2 and CW3.

 \item Model betas: A colour plot of model beta estimates. Where applicable,
 2nd order coefficients (quadratic) and 3rd order coefficients (cubic) will
 be plotted seperately.

 \item Histogram(s): If DatasetRand is provided, plotall will create two
 stacked histograms to compare the deltaAICc of non-randomised and randomised
 data. This can help determine the likelihood of obtaining a deltaAICc value
 for a fitted climate window model at random. Without DatasetRand, plotall
 will create a single histogram of deltaAICc values for all fitted climate
 windows.

 \item Boxplots: Two boxplots showing the opening and closing day for a
 subset of best climate windows. Best climate windows make up the
 cumulative model weight equivalent to the largest value of CW1, CW2 and CW3.

 \item Best Model: If BestModel and BestModelData are provided, plotall will
 create a scatterplot to show the fit of the best model through the data. }
