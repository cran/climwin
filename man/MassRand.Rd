\title{Example output dataframe from function randwin.}
\format{A data frame with 25,755 rows and 18 variables.
\describe{
  \item{deltaAICc}{Difference between model AICc of fitted climate window and a null model containing no climate.}
  \item{WindowOpen}{The start day of each tested climate window. Furthest from the biological record.}
  \item{WindowClose}{The end day of each tested climate window. Closest to the biological record.}
  \item{ModelBeta}{Beta estimate of the relationship between temperature and mass.}
  \item{ModelBetaQ}{Quadratic beta estimate of the relationship between temperature and mass.}
  \item{ModelBetaC}{Cubic beta estimate of the relationship between temperature and mass.}
  \item{ModelInt}{Model intercept.}
  \item{Function}{The function used to fit climate (e.g. linear ("lin"), quadratic ("quad"))}
  \item{furthest}{Furthest day back considered in climatewin.}
  \item{closest}{Closest day back considered in climatewin.}
  \item{Statistics}{The aggregate statistic used to analyse climate (e.g. mean, max, slope).}
  \item{type}{Whether "fixed" or "variable" climate windows were tested.}
  \item{K}{Number of folds used for k-fold cross validation.}
  \item{ModWeight}{Model weight of each fitted climate window.}
  \item{cutoff.day,cutoff.month}{If type is "fixed", the date from which the climate window was tested.}
  \item{Randomised}{Whether the data was generated using \code{\link{climatewin}} or \code{\link{randwin}}.}
  \item{Repeat}{The number of randomisations carried out.}
